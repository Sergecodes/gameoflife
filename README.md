The Game of Life is a cellular automaton where the state of a cell at time tt is defined by the state of its neighbors at time t−1t−1. You are required to implement a two-dimensional array representing an infinite grid. For this test, we will consider a fixed-size grid of 5x5.

Rules: <br>
    * Any live cell with two or three live neighbors remains alive in the next generation. <br>
    * Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes alive in the next generation. <br>
    * All other cells die in the next generation.
